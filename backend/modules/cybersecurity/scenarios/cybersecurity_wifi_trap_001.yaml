title: "The WiFi Trap"
max_steps: 6

rubric:
  goal: >
    Resolve urgency-vs-security conflict by maintaining secure connection hygiene
    while preserving business continuity. Gold standard: choose secure method
    even under severe time pressure and communicate transparently.
  key_concepts:
    - Secure connection hygiene
    - Rogue access point risk
    - VPN and hotspot policy
    - Data protection under pressure
    - Incident prevention
  few_shot_examples:
    - choice: "Join late via secure hotspot and communicate delay to Mira and VP"
      score: 92
      reasoning: >
        Prioritizes security over convenience. Transparent communication maintains
        trust and sets proper expectations. Follows IT guidance.
    - choice: "Ask Mira to cover your section while you connect safely"
      score: 85
      reasoning: >
        Delegation with secure fallback. Protects sensitive material and preserves
        meeting continuity through role coordination.
    - choice: "Connect to Airport_Free to get in quickly, minimize screen sharing"
      score: 35
      reasoning: >
        Yields to pressure. Open Wi-Fi exposes credentials and session data.
        Partial mitigation insufficient against fake access point risk.
    - choice: "Use the fast network but only share non-sensitive slides"
      score: 48
      reasoning: >
        Attempts compromise but still violates policy. Sensitive notes and
        unreleased pricing in slide deck remain exposed. Sets bad precedent.

entry_turn:
  situation: >
    You are Alex at an airport gate, ten minutes from presenting to leadership.
    Two open networks appear: "Airport_Free" and "Airport_Free_5G_Fast." Mira,
    your teammate, keeps texting that audio checks are failing and the VP is
    already online. Yesterday, Kunal from IT sent a rule: use hotspot plus VPN
    only, no open airport Wi-Fi. Your hotspot is flickering. Battery is at 8%.
    Mira sends: "If you are not in by minute three, I cannot cover your section."
  turn_order:
    - mira
    - kunal
  directives:
    mira: "Express urgent pressure about the meeting and inability to cover much longer."
    kunal: "Reiterate the VPN/hotspot policy and risks of open networks."
  actor_reactions:
    - actor_id: mira
      dialogue: "Alex, the VP is literally waiting. Can you get in or not?"
    - actor_id: kunal
      dialogue: "Open Wi-Fi at airports is a classic attack vector. Hotspot and VPN only."
  choices_offered:
    - label: "Join late via secure hotspot and communicate delay transparently"
      valence: positive
    - label: "Connect to the fast network but only show non-sensitive slides"
      valence: neutral
    - label: "Connect to Airport_Free to make the meeting on time"
      valence: negative
