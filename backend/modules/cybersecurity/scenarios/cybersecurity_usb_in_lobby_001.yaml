max_steps: 6

rubric:
  goal: >
    Resolve social-engineering exposure by choosing containment over curiosity
    and following incident procedure. Gold standard: stop insertion, secure
    device, and route through proper chain-of-custody.
  key_concepts:
    - Unknown media risk
    - Bait device / staged malware
    - Incident reporting and chain-of-custody
    - Social engineering awareness
    - Safe media handling
  few_shot_examples:
    - choice: "Do not plug it in. Bag it, label it, and hand to security per protocol"
      score: 95
      reasoning: >
        Immediate containment. Follows incident procedure and prevents
        potential execution. Corrects risk before any damage.
    - choice: "Stop Dev from plugging in, record location/time, route to incident channel"
      score: 88
      reasoning: >
        Recognizes bait-device risk and initiates proper reporting.
        May need to reinforce chain-of-custody with Dev.
    - choice: "Let Dev plug into his personal laptop first to check contents"
      score: 22
      reasoning: >
        Personal laptop is still a vector. Threat actors count on exactly
        this confidence. Introduces direct compromise risk.
    - choice: "Take the USB to IT and ask them to scan it before returning"
      score: 55
      reasoning: >
        Better than insertion but still involves handling unknown media.
        Policy says do not insert anywhere; secure and report first.

  situation: >
    You are Alex, entering the office lobby before sunrise. A black USB drive
    with your company logo sits near the visitor kiosk. Dev from design picks
    it up: "Could be the CFO's deck for the town hall. We should check and
    return it fast." Isha from security spots the device and strides over,
    expression tightening. Last week she sent a company-wide reminder that
    unknown media can carry staged malware. Dev says he will plug it into his
    personal laptop first—not the corporate one. Isha reaches you: "Do not
    insert it anywhere. Bag it, label it, chain-of-custody."
  turn_order:
    - dev
