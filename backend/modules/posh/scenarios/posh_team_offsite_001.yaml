title: "Team Offsite"
max_steps: 6

rubric:
  goal: >
    Resolve a power-imbalanced boundary conflict by choosing a safe and
    professional response, preserving dignity, and moving the conversation
    to an accountable channel. Gold standard: clear boundary, public/transparent
    meeting structure, document if pressure persists.
  key_concepts:
    - Boundary setting
    - Power imbalance
    - Private vs public mentorship
    - POSH and harassment prevention
    - Professional meeting norms
  few_shot_examples:
    - choice: "Decline private meeting; propose daytime public mentoring slot; confirm by message"
      score: 92
      reasoning: >
        Direct boundary. Moves mentorship to transparent space.
        Documented alternative protects both parties.
    - choice: "Accept Kabir's exit cue; move to common area; restate professional norms"
      score: 85
      reasoning: >
        Ally-supported path. Uses witness presence.
        Redirects without escalating emotionally.
    - choice: "Go in for ten minutes; keep it professional"
      score: 25
      reasoning: >
        Compromises boundary. Private hotel room with
        person who controls your ratings is high risk.
    - choice: "Make an excuse and leave quickly"
      score: 55
      reasoning: >
        Avoids situation but does not set clear boundary.
        Vague refusal may not prevent repeat pressure.

  situation: >
    You are Alex, six months into your first corporate role, in the
    hotel corridor after the team offsite dinner. Riya, your team
    lead, swipes her keycard and turns back: "Come in for ten minutes.
    I want to talk about your growth plan before review season."
    Kabir appears at the lift lobby with two coffees: "I was heading
    to the lounge. You coming?" Riya laughs: "No need to make this
    awkward." She does not step away from the door. Riya controls
    your project ratings. Kabir is offering an exit. Riya adds:
    "I am trying to help you. Do not overthink this."
