    - choice: "Clarify the bias-coded comment; restate your technical point calmly"
      score: 90
      reasoning: >
        Direct correction. Addresses harm without derailing stand-up.
        Sets standard for technical discourse.
    - choice: "Ask Meera to formalize a respectful communication norm"

        become accepted culture. Velocity at cost of safety.

      reasoning: >
        Addresses harm but may escalate emotionally.
        Calm direct correction more effective than confrontation.

entry_turn:
  situation: >
    You are Alex, in the Monday stand-up, explaining a production bug
    you traced over the weekend: failing service, rollback window,
    patch plan. Vik leans back: "Can someone from backend translate
    that into technical terms?" Cameras flicker. Meera, the scrum
    master, goes still: "Alex just gave the technical summary. Do you
    have a specific question, Vik?" Vik shrugs: "Relax, I meant no
    disrespect." He glances at the clock. Meera looks at you, giving
    you the floor. The bug is urgent. So is the standard for how
    technical credibility is granted in this room.
