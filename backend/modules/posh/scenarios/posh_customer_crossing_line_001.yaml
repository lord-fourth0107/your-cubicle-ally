title: "Customer Crossing Line"
max_steps: 6

rubric:
  goal: >
    Resolve inappropriate customer behavior while maintaining professional
    control of the meeting and protecting personal boundaries.
    Gold standard: name conduct, reset tone, protect boundary and deal.
  key_concepts:
    - Boundary setting with clients
    - Inappropriate conduct
    - Meeting control
    - Account governance
    - Professional response to sexualized comments
  few_shot_examples:
    - choice: "Name the comment as inappropriate; reset tone; proceed on agenda"
      score: 92
      reasoning: >
        Boundary plus continuity. Clear professional reset.
        Whatever you normalize now repeats in future calls.
    - choice: "Ask Sara to take technical lead; you re-anchor commercial discussion"
      score: 88
      reasoning: >
        Team handoff. Reduces your screen presence.
        Maintains control without direct confrontation.
    - choice: "Laugh it off and redirect to pricing"
      score: 28
      reasoning: >
        Accommodates behavior. "Charm is part of the sale"
        normalizes inappropriate conduct. Unsafe.
    - choice: "End the meeting and escalate through account governance"
      score: 75
      reasoning: >
        Strong boundary. May be right if behavior persists.
        Could have tried reset first for single incident.

entry_turn:
  situation: >
    You are Alex, leading a renewal demo that decides one-third of
    your quarter target. The call is on camera. Neel, the client
    procurement head, watches you instead of the slides. Sara your
    solutions engineer is sharing architecture when Neel interrupts:
    "Can Alex stay full screen? She explains things better when we
    can see her." Sara redirects to pricing. Neel chuckles: "No
    offense, but charm is part of the sale, right?" In chat, Sara
    messages: "I can step in. Your call." She keeps speaking to buy
    you five seconds. Neel waits for your reaction, amused.
