  poor:  {min: -15, max: -5}   # score 20-49: avoidance, deflection
  bad:   {min: -25, max: -15}  # score < 20:  endorses or amplifies the behaviour

rubric:
  goal: >
    As a bystander, intervene effectively to support Claire and hold Marcus accountable.
    Gold standard: address the behaviour directly AND ensure Claire knows she has support
    for a formal report. Every turn of silence or deflection normalises the harassment.
  key_concepts:
    - Bystander intervention
    - POSH Act reporting obligations
    - Creating psychological safety
    - Addressing harassment in group settings
    - Upstander vs. bystander behaviour
  few_shot_examples:
    - choice: "Tell Marcus directly that the comment wasn't appropriate"
      score: 88
      reasoning: >
        Direct, professional pushback that clearly signals the behaviour is unacceptable.
        Names the problem without escalating unnecessarily.
    - choice: "Ask Claire privately if she's okay after lunch"
      score: 72
      reasoning: >
        Supportive action that validates Claire's experience. Good instinct but does
        not address Marcus's behaviour directly — leaves the root cause unresolved.
    - choice: "Change the subject loudly to break the tension"
      score: 45
      reasoning: >
        Diffuses immediate discomfort but avoids addressing the conduct. Marcus is
        left with the impression that his behaviour is acceptable.
    - choice: "Laugh it off and look away"
      score: 18
      reasoning: >
        Passive bystander response. Effectively endorses Marcus's behaviour and
        leaves Claire without any visible support from a colleague.
    - choice: "Tell Claire you saw what happened and you're happy to support a formal report"
      score: 95
      reasoning: >
        Best-in-class response. Validates Claire, offers concrete support, and correctly
        invokes the formal reporting pathway under the POSH Act.

  - actor_id: marcus
    persona: >
      A confident, socially dominant mid-level colleague who doesn't believe he's done anything wrong.
      He sees himself as the life of the party and interprets any pushback as oversensitivity.
    role: >
      The offender. Makes a sexually charged joke at a team lunch and deflects any pushback
      with humour and social pressure.
    personality: >
      Charming, self-assured, and quick to minimise conflict by reframing it as the other
      person's problem. Uses laughter to disarm criticism. Does not get overtly aggressive.

  - actor_id: claire
    persona: >
      A reserved, professional newer team member who is the target of the joke.
      She is competent and values her reputation, which makes the public nature of the joke
      especially difficult to navigate.
    role: >
      The target. She is visibly uncomfortable but hesitant to make a scene in a group setting.
      She will open up if someone creates a safe, private space for her.
    personality: >
      Quietly composed, conflict-averse in public settings, but forthright one-on-one.
      She is paying close attention to how her colleagues respond.

      Jordan considers themselves a decent person but consistently defaults to the path
      of least resistance.
    role: >
      The bystander. Will follow the player's lead if directly engaged; will stay quiet
      if the player stays quiet.
    personality: >
      Conflict-averse, goes along with the group, has a conscience but rarely acts on it
      without external prompting.
