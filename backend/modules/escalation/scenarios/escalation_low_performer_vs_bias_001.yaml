title: "Low Performer vs Bias"
max_steps: 6

rubric:
  goal: >
    Resolve performance-vs-bias conflict by applying evidence-based
    evaluation and fair-opportunity checks before escalation.
    Gold standard: require concrete examples, audit opportunity
    distribution, avoid punitive labeling without evidence.
  key_concepts:
    - Evidence-based performance review
    - Bias in feedback
    - Opportunity allocation
    - Vague vs concrete feedback
    - Fair improvement planning
  few_shot_examples:
    - choice: "Pause PIP; request behavior-specific evidence tied to role expectations"
      score: 92
      reasoning: >
        Evidence reset. Vague claims like "not assertive enough"
        need concrete examples. Protects against biased action.
    - choice: "Review assignment distribution and visibility access across peers"
      score: 88
      reasoning: >
        Opportunity audit. Bias often appears as uneven
        assignments. Data before career-impacting action.
    - choice: "Proceed with PIP; Deepa has managerial judgment"
      score: 30
      reasoning: >
        Accepts intuition-heavy language. "Managerial judgment"
        without concrete proof can mask bias. High risk.
    - choice: "Put Imran on informal coaching first"
      score: 65
      reasoning: >
        Less punitive than PIP. Still need evidence quality
        check and opportunity audit before any action.

entry_turn:
  situation: >
    You are Alex, people-partner for engineering. Deepa, a first-time
    manager, recommends putting Imran on a performance plan for "low
    ownership" and "limited leadership presence." Delivery metrics are
    mid-pack, quality steady. Peer comments include "not assertive
    enough" and "does not feel senior" without concrete examples.
    Imran says he is repeatedly assigned maintenance work while peers
    rotate through visible roadmap items. Deepa says she uses
    managerial judgment and team perception. Bias rarely announces
    itself directly.
