max_steps: 6

rubric:
  goal: >
    Resolve informal complaint conflict by balancing confidentiality,
    psychological safety, and process accountability. Gold standard:
    empathic support, capture facts confidentially, structured
    intervention with documentation plan.
  key_concepts:
    - Informal vs formal resolution
    - Repeated conduct risk
    - Psychological safety
    - Trauma-informed response
    - Documentation for accountability
  few_shot_examples:
    - choice: "Capture facts confidentially; agree intervention plan; monitor"
      score: 90
      reasoning: >
        Supported informal path. Respects Sana's request while
        ensuring accountability. Documented for pattern escalation.
    - choice: "Explain formal thresholds; initiate formal route with Sana's consent"
      score: 85
      reasoning: >
        Early formal. Informed consent. May feel heavy but
        protects if pattern continues. Clear options.
    - choice: "Dismiss as jokes; suggest Sana develop thicker skin"
      score: 10
      reasoning: >
        Minimizes harm. Reinforces unsafe environment.
        High risk of recurrence and trust breakdown.
    - choice: "Give Harsh a verbal warning only; no documentation"
      score: 45
      reasoning: >
        Intervenes but leaves no trail. Repeated conduct
        requires documentation. Weak accountability.

entry_turn:
  situation: >
    You are Alex, team operations partner. Sana asks for a private
    conversation after stand-up. Harsh has made repeated comments
    about her accent in meetings, usually framed as jokes. "I do not
    want a formal complaint," Sana says. "I just want it to stop
    without drama." Harsh is central to a release this week and
    influential; people excuse his behavior as bluntness. Sana asks
    you not to tell anyone unless necessary. Policy: informal
    resolution allowed, but repeated conduct requires documented
    follow-up. No documentation protects confidentiality today but
    weakens accountability tomorrow.
