title: "Side Gig Conflict"
max_steps: 6

rubric:
  goal: >
    Resolve loyalty-vs-duty conflict by using disclosure, scope boundaries,
    and policy-first decision making. Gold standard: pause until formal review,
    then set explicit guardrails or decline.
  key_concepts:
    - Conflict of interest
    - Incremental leakage risk
    - Outside work policy
    - Disclosure and review process
    - Boundary setting
  few_shot_examples:
    - choice: "Decline participation until formal review outcome; explain to Tanvi"
      score: 92
      reasoning: >
        Full pause per ethics guidance. Protects confidential overlap.
        Clear, principled boundary despite relationship pressure.
    - choice: "Propose narrow non-overlapping advisory scope only after Omar approves"
      score: 85
      reasoning: >
        Seeks approval path. May allow limited engagement if no
        confidential overlap. Documented and constrained.
    - choice: "Proceed with advisory help; avoid roadmap and vendor topics"
      score: 40
      reasoning: >
        Self-policing is insufficient. Incremental leakage risk remains.
        Policy requires formal review before any engagement.
    - choice: "Do it for two weeks while Omar reviews"
      score: 25
      reasoning: >
        Proceeds informally. Violates disclosure process.
        Exposes confidential strategy to competitive overlap.

entry_turn:
  situation: >
    You are Alex, product manager for an internal analytics platform.
    Tanvi, your closest friend from college, messages at 10 p.m.: she is
    building a startup and wants "just advisory help" two evenings a week.
    Her brief includes workforce insights, manager dashboards, attrition
    prediction—almost mirroring your confidential roadmap. Omar from ethics
    replied to your disclosure draft: "Potential competitive overlap.
    Do not proceed until reviewed." Tanvi sounds hurt: "I am not asking you
    to leak anything. I trust your integrity." Omar's policy: outside work
    allowed only when it does not intersect with privileged strategy.
  turn_order:
    - tanvi
    - omar
  directives:
    tanvi: "Frame overlap as harmless; emphasize trust and investor momentum."
    omar: "Reinforce pause and formal review path."
  actor_reactions:
    - actor_id: tanvi
      dialogue: "Two weeks of review could cost me my investor. You know I would never ask for anything confidential."
    - actor_id: omar
      dialogue: "Policy is clear. No engagement until review. Conflict risk is incremental—a suggestion here, a benchmark there."
