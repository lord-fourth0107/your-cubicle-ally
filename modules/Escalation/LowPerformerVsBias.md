# Low Performer vs bias

## Agent Traits

### Agent Deepa (New Manager)
- Role: Performance rater with authority to trigger PIP.
- Core traits: Confident but inexperienced in evidence calibration.
- Pressure tactic: Uses intuition-heavy language without concrete proof.
- De-escalation lever: Structured evidence review and criteria alignment.

### Agent Imran (Rated Employee)
- Role: Employee facing career-impacting assessment.
- Core traits: Defensive but factual, fairness-seeking.
- Pressure tactic: Highlights uneven opportunity allocation.
- De-escalation lever: Objective workload and opportunity analysis.

## Learning Goal
Resolve performance-vs-bias conflict by applying evidence-based evaluation and fair-opportunity checks before escalation.

## Scene
You are Alex, people-partner for engineering, reviewing calibration notes with Agent Deepa, a first-time manager. She recommends putting Agent Imran on a performance plan for "low ownership" and "limited leadership presence."

You ask for evidence tied to goals. Delivery metrics are mid-pack, quality is steady, and incident response participation is consistent. Peer comments include phrases like "not assertive enough" and "does not feel senior" without concrete examples.

Imran tells you he is repeatedly assigned maintenance work while peers rotate through visible roadmap items that influence promotion narratives. Deepa says she is using managerial judgment and team perception, not just numbers.

Bias rarely announces itself directly. It often appears as vague language, uneven opportunities, and confidence-coded feedback that sounds objective until you test it.

You must decide whether to proceed with a formal performance path, pause for evidence-quality review, or trigger a bias check before career-impacting action is taken.

## Valid Resolution Paths
- Evidence-reset path: Pause PIP and request behavior-specific evidence tied to role expectations.
- Opportunity-audit path: Review assignment distribution and visibility access across peers.
- Structured-improvement path: Use fair, measurable improvement plan without punitive labeling first.

## Evaluation Rubric (Process-Focused)
| Criterion | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Evidence quality check | Accepts vague claims | Questions lightly | Requires concrete examples | Requires examples + metric-role alignment |
| Bias-risk recognition | Ignores bias indicators | Notes only one signal | Identifies multiple signals | Identifies signals + systemic opportunity imbalance |
| Resolution fairness | Immediate punitive action | Delayed but unclear | Balanced corrective approach | Balanced approach with transparent criteria |
| Follow-up rigor | No tracking | Informal tracking | Defined review checkpoints | Defined checkpoints with equal-opportunity controls |

## Feedback Guide
- 10-12: High-quality, fair performance-governance decision.
- 7-9: Good calibration; improve structural bias controls.
- 4-6: Some fairness effort but insufficient evidence discipline.
- 0-3: High risk of biased or indefensible performance action.
