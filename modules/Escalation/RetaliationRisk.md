# Retaliation Risk

## Agent Traits

### Agent Jae (Witness/Reporter)
- Role: Participant in ongoing misconduct inquiry.
- Core traits: Anxious, principled, risk-exposed.
- Pressure tactic: Signals immediate fear of punishment after speaking up.
- De-escalation lever: Interim protections and transparent process updates.

### Agent Ron (Manager Under Inquiry)
- Role: Decision authority over staffing.
- Core traits: Defensive, operationally assertive, optics-aware.
- Pressure tactic: Reframes adverse action as routine performance management.
- De-escalation lever: Objective evidence review and temporary decision controls.

## Learning Goal
Resolve potential retaliation conflict by protecting investigation integrity and employee safety while preserving procedural fairness.

## Scene
You are Alex, supporting an ongoing workplace misconduct inquiry. Agent Jae submitted witness notes last week. Today, Agent Ron, Jae's manager and the subject of that inquiry, removes Jae from a high-visibility client stream and cites "fit and performance alignment."

Jae asks for an urgent meeting and says the timing feels punitive. "I knew this would happen if I spoke," Jae says. Ron, in his own call with you, insists it is routine staffing and warns that HR interference will damage delivery.

The investigation is active, facts are incomplete, and both narratives are plausible on the surface. But retaliation risk often hides behind ordinary business language.

Policy says employees participating in investigations must be protected from adverse action connected to participation. It also says management retains staffing discretion when documented objectively.

Your next step must protect process integrity and people at once: too passive and harm compounds, too aggressive and you risk procedural overreach without evidence.

## Valid Resolution Paths
- Protective-hold path: Pause disputed staffing decision pending neutral review.
- Evidence-first path: Collect objective basis and compare against prior performance records.
- Safeguard path: Keep decision active only with interim anti-retaliation protections and monitoring.

## Evaluation Rubric (Process-Focused)
| Criterion | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Retaliation-risk detection | Accepts action at face value | Notices timing only | Flags retaliation concern | Flags concern + policy-protected status |
| Fair process design | Takes one side immediately | Informal balancing only | Neutral fact-finding initiated | Neutral fact-finding + temporary safeguards |
| Stakeholder protection | No support for reporter | Minimal support | Provides support and updates | Provides support, updates, and anti-retaliation controls |
| Decision governance | Undocumented decision | Weak rationale | Documented rationale | Documented rationale with review/audit trail |

## Feedback Guide
- 10-12: Strong retaliation-risk governance and fair-process control.
- 7-9: Sound approach; improve protection timing or audit depth.
- 4-6: Partial fairness with residual safety gaps.
- 0-3: Serious process-integrity and trust failure.
