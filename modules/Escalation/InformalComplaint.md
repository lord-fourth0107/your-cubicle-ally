# Informal Complaint

## Agent Traits

### Agent Sana (Reporting Employee)
- Role: Affected team member seeking safety without formal process.
- Core traits: Trust-seeking, fatigued, cautious about retaliation.
- Pressure tactic: Requests confidentiality with minimal visibility.
- De-escalation lever: Trauma-informed listening and clear options.

### Agent Harsh (Accused Peer)
- Role: High-performing colleague with repeated harmful behavior.
- Core traits: Influential, results-focused, dismissive of impact.
- Pressure tactic: Behavior normalized as "jokes" under stress.
- De-escalation lever: Specific behavior boundary, documented expectations.

## Learning Goal
Resolve an informal complaint conflict by balancing confidentiality, psychological safety, and process accountability.

## Scene
You are Alex, team operations partner, when Agent Sana asks for a private conversation after stand-up. She says Agent Harsh has made repeated comments about her accent in meetings, usually framed as jokes. "I do not want a formal complaint," she says. "I just want it to stop without drama."

Harsh is central to a release due this week. He is also influential, and people tend to excuse his behavior as bluntness under stress. Sana asks you not to tell anyone she spoke to you unless necessary.

You open the policy. Informal resolution is allowed, but repeated conduct still requires documented follow-up in case patterns escalate. No documentation protects confidentiality today, but weakens accountability tomorrow.

Sana says she is exhausted from calculating the social cost of speaking up. Harsh messages you minutes later about sprint blockers, unaware of the conversation that just happened.

You now hold a complaint that is unofficial in form but serious in impact. How you escalate, document, or intervene will set precedent for psychological safety on the team.

## Valid Resolution Paths
- Supported-informal path: Capture facts confidentially, agree intervention plan, and monitor.
- Early-formal path: Explain thresholds and initiate formal route with Sana's informed consent.
- Protective hybrid path: Immediate safety steps plus documented behavioral warning channel.

## Evaluation Rubric (Process-Focused)
| Criterion | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Harm assessment | Minimizes complaint | Acknowledges discomfort only | Identifies repeated conduct risk | Identifies risk + retaliation/safety implications |
| Reporter support | Dismissive or coercive | Partial listening | Empathic, option-based support | Empathic support + informed consent clarity |
| Accountability action | No intervention | Verbal warning only | Structured intervention | Structured intervention with documentation plan |
| Case stewardship | No follow-up | Ad hoc follow-up | Planned follow-up checkpoints | Planned follow-up + escalation criteria defined |

## Feedback Guide
- 10-12: Excellent balance of care, fairness, and accountability.
- 7-9: Good handling; improve documentation or follow-up rigor.
- 4-6: Supportive but procedurally fragile approach.
- 0-3: High risk of harm recurrence and trust breakdown.
