# Microagression in Stand-ups

## Agent Traits

### Agent Vik (Peer Engineer)
- Role: Influential teammate who undermines credibility indirectly.
- Core traits: Defensive, dismissive, socially performative.
- Pressure tactic: Minimizes bias as harmless efficiency.
- De-escalation lever: Specific correction anchored to facts and team norms.

### Agent Meera (Scrum Master)
- Role: Process owner and norm enforcer.
- Core traits: Calm, procedural, fairness-oriented.
- Pressure tactic: None; creates protected speaking space.
- De-escalation lever: Facilitates direct clarification and expectation reset.

## Learning Goal
Resolve a microaggression in real time without collapsing team effectiveness, while reinforcing respectful technical discourse.

## Scene
You are Alex, in the Monday stand-up, halfway through explaining a production bug you traced over the weekend. You describe the failing service, the rollback window, and the patch plan. Agent Vik leans back and says, "Can someone from backend translate that into technical terms?"

A few cameras flicker as people process what just happened. Agent Meera, the scrum master, goes still and does not move to the next update. "Alex just gave the technical summary," she says evenly. "Do you have a specific question, Vik?"

Vik shrugs and smiles like it was harmless. "Relax, I meant no disrespect." He glances at the clock, trying to force the meeting forward. Meera looks at you before saying anything else, giving you the floor without making you defend your expertise alone.

You can let it pass and keep velocity, or address it and risk being labeled difficult before sprint planning. The choice is not only about one sentence. It is about whether repeated small cuts become accepted team culture.

At 9:08 a.m., the bug is still urgent, but so is the standard for how technical credibility is granted in this room.

## Valid Resolution Paths
- Direct correction path: Clarify the bias-coded comment and restate technical point.
- Facilitated norms path: Ask Meera to formalize a respectful communication norm.
- Private-plus-public path: Continue stand-up now, then address pattern with Meera/Vik after.

## Evaluation Rubric (Process-Focused)
| Criterion | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pattern recognition | Treats as normal banter | Sees isolated slight | Identifies microaggression | Identifies pattern risk to team culture |
| Response clarity | Silence/retreat | Defensive or vague | Calm direct correction | Calm correction + norm framing |
| Team continuity | Meeting breaks down | Partial disruption | Keeps workflow on track | Keeps workflow plus culture correction |
| Follow-through | No next step | Informal only | Raises with facilitator | Tracks repeated behavior with evidence |

## Feedback Guide
- 10-12: Strong bias interruption and team-stability handling.
- 7-9: Good correction; strengthen pattern-tracking or norm-setting.
- 4-6: Partially effective; message lacked clarity or continuity control.
- 0-3: Microaggression normalized or conflict mishandled.
