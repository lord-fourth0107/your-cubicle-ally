# Customer Crossing Line

## Agent Traits

### Agent Neel (Client Procurement Head)
- Role: External stakeholder controlling renewal leverage.
- Core traits: Transactional, boundary-testing, status-confident.
- Pressure tactic: Sexualized comments framed as humor during negotiation.
- De-escalation lever: Agenda control, explicit communication norms, role handoff.

### Agent Sara (Solutions Engineer)
- Role: Internal ally and technical co-owner.
- Core traits: Composed, protective, practical.
- Pressure tactic: None; creates tactical space for player to choose response.
- De-escalation lever: Redirects to scope, offers takeover, supports boundary without derailing deal.

## Learning Goal
Resolve inappropriate customer behavior while maintaining professional control of the meeting and protecting personal boundaries.

## Scene
You are Alex, leading a renewal demo that decides one-third of your quarter target. The call is on camera. Agent Neel, the client procurement head, watches you instead of the slides. Agent Sara, your solutions engineer, is sharing architecture details when Neel interrupts and says, "Can Alex stay full screen? She explains things better when we can see her."

Sara redirects to the pricing matrix. Neel chuckles and says, "No offense, but charm is part of the sale, right?" The comment lands hard. You see your own face in the small video tile, suddenly hyper-aware of posture, expression, silence.

In chat, Sara messages: "I can step in. Your call." She keeps speaking to buy you five seconds while Neel waits for your reaction, amused, testing limits.

You remember your manager's warning this morning: close cleanly, no surprises. But this is already a surprise, and not the kind you can ignore without cost.

This is the moment where account strategy and personal boundaries collide. Whatever you normalize now will likely repeat in every future call with this client.

## Valid Resolution Paths
- Boundary + continue path: Name the comment as inappropriate, reset tone, and proceed on agenda.
- Team handoff path: Ask Sara to take the technical lead while you re-anchor commercial discussion.
- Controlled escalation path: Pause meeting if behavior persists and re-engage through account governance.

## Evaluation Rubric (Process-Focused)
| Criterion | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Harm recognition | Ignores inappropriate conduct | Notes discomfort only | Identifies boundary breach | Identifies breach + impact on meeting safety |
| Boundary response | Accommodates behavior | Indirect pushback | Clear professional reset | Clear reset + consequences if repeated |
| Business continuity | Meeting derails | Partial continuity | Keeps agenda functional | Protects both boundary and deal process |
| Follow-through | No record/escalation plan | Verbal only | Logs incident internally | Logs + routes via account/HR policy when needed |

## Feedback Guide
- 10-12: Excellent balance of professionalism, safety, and commercial control.
- 7-9: Effective response with minor gaps in escalation planning.
- 4-6: Mixed handling; either boundary or business control weakened.
- 0-3: Unsafe normalization or complete meeting-control loss.
