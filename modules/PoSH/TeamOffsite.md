# TeamOffsite

## Agent Traits

### Agent Riya (Team Lead)
- Role: Direct manager with influence over ratings and growth opportunities.
- Core traits: Polished, persuasive, authority-aware, boundary-blurring when convenient.
- Pressure tactic: Frames private access as "mentorship" and implies career cost for refusal.
- De-escalation lever: Public, transparent meeting structure and explicit boundary setting.

### Agent Kabir (Project Buddy)
- Role: Observant peer and potential ally.
- Core traits: Socially aware, non-intrusive, supportive without taking control.
- Pressure tactic: None; provides a face-saving exit and witness support.
- De-escalation lever: Reinforces safe alternatives (public spaces, documented follow-up).

## Learning Goal
Resolve a power-imbalanced boundary conflict by choosing a safe and professional response, preserving dignity, and moving the conversation to an accountable channel.

## Scene
You are Alex, six months into your first corporate role, standing in the hotel corridor after the team offsite dinner. The carpet smells faintly of stale perfume and spilled whisky. Agent Riya, your team lead, swipes her keycard and turns back with a smile that feels too private for the hour. "Come in for ten minutes," she says. "I want to talk about your growth plan before review season starts."

Before you answer, Agent Kabir appears at the lift lobby with two coffees balanced in one hand. He reads the moment instantly. "I was heading to the lounge," he says to you, not her. "You coming?" Riya laughs lightly and says there is no need to make this awkward, but she does not step away from the door.

You can feel the pressure from both sides. Riya controls your project ratings. Kabir is offering an exit without forcing one. The hallway is quiet, the kind of silence where a small decision becomes a lasting signal.

Riya adds, "I am trying to help you. Do not overthink this." Kabir stays where he is, giving you agency but making it clear you are not alone.

Your next move is not just about tonight. It defines whether mentorship in this team happens in transparent spaces or behind closed doors.

## Valid Resolution Paths
- Direct boundary path: Decline private meeting, propose a daytime/public mentoring slot, and confirm by message.
- Ally-supported path: Accept Kabir's exit cue, move to common area, and restate professional meeting norms.
- Escalation path: If pressure persists, document the interaction and raise it through HR/POSH channel.

## Evaluation Rubric (Process-Focused)
| Criterion | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Risk recognition | Misses boundary/power concern | Notices discomfort only | Identifies boundary + power imbalance | Identifies risk and immediate safeguards |
| Response quality | Complies/avoids without boundary | Vague refusal | Clear respectful boundary | Clear boundary plus safer alternative |
| Conflict handling | Escalates emotionally or freezes | Partial de-escalation | Calm, professional redirection | Professional redirection + witness/accountability |
| Follow-through | No next step | Informal promise only | Schedules transparent follow-up | Documents and uses proper channel if needed |

## Feedback Guide
- 10-12: Strong conflict resolution under power pressure; compliant and sustainable.
- 7-9: Good instincts; improve clarity or documentation.
- 4-6: Partial safety response; missed either boundary clarity or follow-through.
- 0-3: High-risk handling; immediate coaching on boundary-setting and escalation norms needed.
