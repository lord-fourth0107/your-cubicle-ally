## Learning Goal
Resolve personal-pressure conflict in procurement by protecting fairness, transparency, and auditability.

## Scene
You are Alex, procurement lead for a high-value facilities contract, reviewing final vendor bids in a sealed process. Your phone lights up with a message from Agent Priyank, your childhood friend and one of the bidders: "I do not need exact numbers. Just tell me if we are close. I cannot lose this one."

In the next cubicle, Agent Lata from compliance is preparing the opening meeting and reminds everyone that fairness depends on information symmetry. No bidder gets private hints, not even indirectly.

Priyank calls before you can reply. You hear strain in his voice. Payroll is due in ten days. "You know I can deliver," he says. "Help me avoid a technical loss." He frames it as friendship, not corruption.

Lata walks over with the bid envelopes and asks if all conflict declarations are current. Her timing is accidental, but the question lands like a spotlight.

You are balancing empathy for someone you care about against fiduciary duty to a process designed to prevent exactly this pressure. One message from you could quietly distort the outcome and still look invisible on paper.

## Valid Resolution Paths
- Firm-no path: Refuse to share any bid intelligence and restate process fairness.
- Recusal path: Declare conflict and transfer decision authority if needed.
- Structured support path: Offer legitimate post-bid debrief channel available to all vendors.

## Evaluation Rubric (Process-Focused)
| Criterion | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Integrity recognition | Treats as harmless favor | Sees risk but minimizes it | Identifies procurement breach risk | Identifies legal, fairness, and audit risk |
| Boundary enforcement | Shares hints | Ambiguous refusal | Clear refusal with policy rationale | Clear refusal + equal-access alternative |
| Conflict management | Hides relationship | Verbal mention only | Declares conflict properly | Declares + adjusts role authority when needed |
| Documentation | None | Informal note | Formal process record | Formal record + preventive control for repeats |

## Feedback Guide
- 10-12: Strong procurement ethics and defensible process control.
- 7-9: Good refusal; strengthen declaration or documentation depth.
- 4-6: Ethical intent visible but execution exposed process risk.
- 0-3: Serious integrity breach in competitive process.
