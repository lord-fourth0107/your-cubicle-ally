## Agent Traits

### Agent Rohan (Buyer)

## Learning Goal
Resolve revenue-vs-privacy conflict by protecting contractual and data-governance obligations under commercial pressure.

## Scene
You are Alex, account lead in a quarter-end renewal call with Agent Rohan, the buyer, and Agent Nisha from your legal team. Rohan says finance will approve the expanded contract today if you share user-level activity logs by department and individual manager.

Nisha opens the agreement and points to the clause permitting only aggregated metrics unless explicit consent exists. Rohan nods, then lowers his voice: "I know what the contract says. I am asking what you can do if the deal matters."

The discount you promised internally depends on this signature. Your sales dashboard is already red. Rohan adds a deadline: "Send detailed logs in one hour, or we freeze procurement until next quarter."

Nisha's tone stays calm. "If we bend here, this becomes precedent. Every future buyer will ask for the same exception." Rohan pushes back: "Then maybe your competitor can be more flexible."

You are now negotiating two currencies at once: revenue and trust. What you disclose today could close the quarter and still expose your company to privacy breach risk tomorrow.

## Valid Resolution Paths
- Contract-first path: Refuse raw data sharing; provide aggregated metrics immediately.
- Consent path: Offer lawful consent-based approach with timeline impact made explicit.
- Executive alignment path: Escalate commercial/legal trade-off for joint decision, not unilateral breach.

## Evaluation Rubric (Process-Focused)
| Criterion | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Privacy-risk recognition | Ignores policy breach | Sees only contract issue | Identifies contract + privacy risk | Identifies legal, trust, and precedent risk |
| Negotiation response | Concedes prohibited request | Delays without stance | Clear compliant stance | Compliant stance + practical alternative |
| Cross-functional handling | Sidelines legal | Partial coordination | Works with legal in real time | Aligns legal, commercial, and escalation path |
| Outcome defensibility | Undocumented exception | Weak rationale | Documented compliant decision | Documented decision with future-control actions |

## Feedback Guide
- 10-12: Excellent compliant negotiation under deadline pressure.
- 7-9: Good control; improve escalation timing or alternative packaging.
- 4-6: Risk identified but response lacked defensible structure.
- 0-3: High-severity data-governance failure.
