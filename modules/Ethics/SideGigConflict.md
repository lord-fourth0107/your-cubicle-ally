# Side gig conflict

## Agent Traits

### Agent Tanvi (Founder Friend)
- Role: Trusted personal contact requesting advisory help.
- Core traits: Urgent, relational, optimistic about boundaries.
- Pressure tactic: Frames overlap as harmless friendship support.
- De-escalation lever: Clear conflict disclosure and scope limits.

### Agent Omar (Ethics Liaison)
- Role: Policy gatekeeper for conflicts of interest.
- Core traits: Precise, risk-focused, process-driven.
- Pressure tactic: Hard pause until review clears engagement.
- De-escalation lever: Formal review path and documented constraints.

## Learning Goal
Resolve loyalty-vs-duty conflict by using disclosure, scope boundaries, and policy-first decision making.

## Scene
You are Alex, product manager for an internal analytics platform, staring at a late-night message from Agent Tanvi, your closest friend from college. She is building a startup and wants "just advisory help" for two evenings a week. Her brief includes workforce insights, manager dashboards, and attrition prediction, almost mirroring features from your confidential roadmap deck.

At 10:12 p.m., Agent Omar from ethics replies to your disclosure draft with one line: "Potential competitive overlap. Do not proceed until reviewed." You call Tanvi to explain the pause. She sounds hurt. "I am not asking you to leak anything," she says. "I trust your integrity."

You do trust yourself. That is what makes this hard. Conflict-of-interest risk is rarely a dramatic theft. It is usually incremental: a suggestion here, a framing there, a benchmark offered from memory.

Omar follows up with policy language: outside work is allowed only when it does not intersect with privileged strategy, vendor plans, or customer-sensitive priorities. Tanvi says waiting two weeks could cost her investor momentum.

You are being asked to choose between immediate loyalty and long-term professional trust. Both people are right about different parts of the problem.

## Valid Resolution Paths
- Full-pause path: Decline participation until formal review outcome.
- Narrow-scope path: Propose non-overlapping advisory scope only after approval.
- Referral path: Decline direct work and suggest alternate advisor resources.

## Evaluation Rubric (Process-Focused)
| Criterion | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Conflict identification | Denies overlap risk | Acknowledges only surface risk | Identifies confidential overlap | Identifies overlap + incremental leakage risk |
| Policy alignment | Proceeds informally | Partial compliance | Follows disclosure process | Follows process and sets explicit guardrails |
| Stakeholder handling | Damages trust with either side | Reactive communication | Clear balanced communication | Balanced communication + principled rationale |
| Closure quality | Leaves ambiguity | Temporary verbal fix | Documented decision | Documented decision + monitoring boundary |

## Feedback Guide
- 10-12: High-integrity conflict resolution with sustainable boundaries.
- 7-9: Sound ethical judgment; improve closure precision.
- 4-6: Recognized risk but process execution was weak.
- 0-3: Significant conflict-of-interest exposure.
