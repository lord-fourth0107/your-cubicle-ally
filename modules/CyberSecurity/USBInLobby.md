# USB in lobby

## Agent Traits

### Agent Dev (Coworker)
- Role: Well-meaning colleague prioritizing speed.
- Core traits: Curious, confident, shortcut-prone.
- Pressure tactic: Minimizes unknown-media risk as overreaction.
- De-escalation lever: Clear incident protocol and immediate containment.

### Agent Isha (Security Lead)
- Role: Security control owner.
- Core traits: Alert, procedural, decisive.
- Pressure tactic: None; insists on chain-of-custody handling.
- De-escalation lever: Simple actionable incident steps.

## Learning Goal
Resolve a social-engineering exposure moment by choosing containment over curiosity and following incident procedure.

## Scene
You are Alex, entering the office lobby before sunrise when something catches your eye near the visitor kiosk: a black USB drive with your company logo stickered on top. Agent Dev from design picks it up and says, "Could be the CFO's deck for the town hall. We should check and return it fast."

Across the desk, Agent Isha from security is finishing a call about phishing simulations. She spots the device in Dev's hand and starts walking toward you both, expression tightening. Last week she sent a company-wide reminder that unknown media can carry staged malware payloads.

Dev waves the warning away. "I will plug it into my personal laptop first. Not the corporate one." He believes that makes it safe. You know threat actors count on exactly this kind of confidence.

Isha reaches you and says, "Do not insert it anywhere. Bag it, label it, chain-of-custody." Dev rolls his eyes and mutters that security always overreacts.

This is a small object and a public place, but the decision path is huge: casual curiosity, or disciplined incident handling before anything executes.

## Valid Resolution Paths
- Immediate containment path: Stop all device use and hand over per security protocol.
- Controlled-report path: Record location/time and route through incident channel.
- Team-education path: Resolve incident and reinforce safe-media norms with Dev.

## Evaluation Rubric (Process-Focused)
| Criterion | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Threat recognition | Treats as benign by default | Unsure risk posture | Recognizes bait-device risk | Recognizes risk and attack intent pattern |
| Immediate action | Plugs into any machine | Delayed stop | Stops insertion attempt | Stops attempt + secures evidence |
| Procedure adherence | No reporting | Informal report only | Follows incident protocol | Follows protocol with complete details |
| Team handling | Reinforces unsafe behavior | Avoids peer conflict | Corrects peer calmly | Corrects peer and improves future behavior |

## Feedback Guide
- 10-12: High-quality incident prevention and control discipline.
- 7-9: Good handling; improve reporting completeness or peer correction.
- 4-6: Partial safety response with operational gaps.
- 0-3: Direct compromise risk introduced.
