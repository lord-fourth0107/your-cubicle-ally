# Password reuse boss

## Agent Traits

### Agent Mark (Department Head)
- Role: Senior leader with high-privilege access.
- Core traits: Decisive, influence-heavy, deadline-sensitive.
- Pressure tactic: Requests policy exception due to business urgency.
- De-escalation lever: Time-boxed secure alternative access path.

### Agent Elena (CISO)
- Role: Cyber risk owner and policy authority.
- Core traits: Principle-led, evidence-based, non-negotiable on controls.
- Pressure tactic: None; insists on equal policy enforcement.
- De-escalation lever: Rapid compliant recovery procedure.

## Learning Goal
Resolve authority-vs-policy conflict by enforcing critical security controls while reducing operational disruption.

## Scene
You are Alex, assisting Agent Elena, the CISO, during a credential audit. A breach-monitoring alert shows Agent Mark, your department head, reused his corporate password on a hobby forum that was compromised last month. Policy requires immediate reset and temporary lock until re-authentication.

Before you trigger the lock, Mark calls. "I have a board review in forty minutes. Do not cut my access now," he says. "I will change it tonight. You have my word." He is direct, accustomed to exceptions being made for high-pressure meetings.

Elena messages you at the same time: "Apply policy as written. Seniority does not reduce exposure." She adds that credential-stuffing attempts are already rising across similar breaches.

If you lock Mark now, you may disrupt a critical executive meeting and absorb the fallout. If you delay, you are knowingly keeping a high-privilege account vulnerable during an active risk window.

This is where cybersecurity policy stops being abstract and becomes organizational character. The standard either applies under pressure or it does not exist.

## Valid Resolution Paths
- Immediate-enforce path: Apply lock/reset now and support expedited re-authentication.
- Controlled continuity path: Enforce policy while arranging temporary least-privilege access.
- Leadership alignment path: Escalate instantly for executive awareness, not policy exception.

## Evaluation Rubric (Process-Focused)
| Criterion | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Threat severity judgment | Minimizes credential risk | Recognizes risk late | Correctly identifies active risk | Correctly identifies risk + high-privilege impact |
| Control enforcement | Grants exception | Delays enforcement | Enforces required controls | Enforces controls with minimal business disruption |
| Authority handling | Submits to pressure | Defensive confrontation | Professional firm response | Professional response + transparent escalation |
| Recovery planning | No recovery path | Ad hoc recovery | Defined recovery steps | Fast, documented, least-privilege recovery plan |

## Feedback Guide
- 10-12: Excellent security governance under executive pressure.
- 7-9: Strong policy adherence; improve recovery orchestration.
- 4-6: Risk recognized but enforcement or communication weak.
- 0-3: Serious credential-risk governance failure.
