# Wifi Trap

## Agent Traits

### Agent Mira (Teammate)
- Role: Delivery partner under meeting pressure.
- Core traits: Urgent, practical, deadline-focused.
- Pressure tactic: Pushes rapid connection due to business stakes.
- De-escalation lever: Alternate join plan and role coverage.

### Agent Kunal (IT Advisor)
- Role: Security standard setter.
- Core traits: Policy-driven, preventative, explicit.
- Pressure tactic: None; prior guidance defines safe baseline.
- De-escalation lever: VPN/hotspot fallback protocol.

## Learning Goal
Resolve urgency-vs-security conflict by maintaining secure connection hygiene while preserving business continuity.

## Scene
You are Alex at an airport gate, ten minutes from presenting to leadership. Two open networks appear: "Airport_Free" and "Airport_Free_5G_Fast." Agent Mira, your teammate, keeps texting that audio checks are failing and the VP is already online.

Yesterday, Agent Kunal from IT sent a hard rule: use hotspot plus VPN only, no open airport Wi-Fi, especially for client material. Your hotspot is flickering between one bar and none. Battery is down to 8 percent.

You try reconnecting twice. The call timer keeps climbing. Mira sends: "If you are not in by minute three, I cannot cover your section." The fast network still shows full strength with no captive portal, almost too convenient.

You open your slide notes and remember they include unreleased pricing strategy. One rushed connection could expose credentials, session cookies, or files through a fake access point designed for exactly this panic window.

Time pressure is making the unsafe option feel reasonable. The trap is not technical complexity. The trap is urgency.

## Valid Resolution Paths
- Secure-delay path: Join late via secure method and communicate delay transparently.
- Coverage path: Let Mira cover your section while you connect safely.
- Sanitized-join path: Join quickly with non-sensitive view only until secure channel is ready.

## Evaluation Rubric (Process-Focused)
| Criterion | 0 points | 1 point | 2 points | 3 points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Risk perception | Trusts open Wi-Fi blindly | Knows risk but yields | Chooses secure approach | Chooses secure approach under severe urgency |
| Continuity planning | No communication fallback | Late reactive update | Clear fallback communication | Proactive fallback with role coordination |
| Data protection | Exposes sensitive content | Partial data controls | Keeps sensitive data protected | Maintains strict data minimization until secure |
| Policy adherence | Directly violates guidance | Ambiguous adherence | Follows IT baseline | Follows baseline and documents exception constraints |

## Feedback Guide
- 10-12: Strong decision quality under time pressure.
- 7-9: Secure choice made; improve contingency communication.
- 4-6: Mixed execution with avoidable exposure windows.
- 0-3: High-risk network behavior under known threat pattern.
